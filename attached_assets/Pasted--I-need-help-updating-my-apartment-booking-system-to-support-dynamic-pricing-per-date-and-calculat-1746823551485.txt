📌 I need help updating my apartment booking system to support dynamic pricing per date and calculating total cost based on selected dates. Here's exactly what I want to do:

## 🔁 Replace Old Static Pricing

Currently, I have this pricing structure per apartment:

```ts
price: 100,
priceHigh: 150,
pricePeak: 180,
```

Please remove this and replace it with a dynamic pricing model based on:

- **4 seasonal tiers**:
  - Out of Season → 45% of peak
  - Low Season → 60%
  - High Season → 80%
  - Peak Season → 100%

- **Season Dates**:
  - 01.10 – 25.04.2025 → Out of Season
  - 26.04 – 06.06.2025 → Low Season
  - 07.06 – 11.07.2025 → High Season
  - 12.07 – 22.08.2025 → Peak Season
  - 23.08 – 26.09.2025 → High Season
  - 27.09 – 24.10.2025 → Low Season
  - 25.10 – 24.04.2026 → Out of Season

- **Base Price:**
  - Apartment *Sea* has a Peak Price of **€110**.

- **Multipliers by apartment**:
```ts
const multipliers = {
  sea: 1.00,
  beach: 1.25,
  sun: 1.75,
  lavander: 2.20,
  roko: 1.50,
  oasis: 1.90,
  ismaelli: 4.00,
};
```

- **Cleaning Fees**:
```ts
const cleaningFees = {
  sea: 40,
  beach: 50,
  sun: 70,
  lavander: 80,
  roko: 40,
  oasis: 50,
  ismaelli: 80,
};
```

## 📅 New Calendar Feature

Please update the calendar component to:

✅ **Show nightly price below each day number**, calculated based on the season, base peak price (€110), and apartment multiplier.

✅ **Allow users to select a start and end date** by clicking on two calendar days.

✅ **Display a summary box below the calendar** with:

- Total nights
- Total price (sum of nightly prices)
- Cleaning fee
- Final total
- Average price per night

---

## 💡 Tech Notes

- The calendar currently receives `bookings` as props and marks unavailable days.
- You may store pricing periods as an array of ranges with coefficients (e.g. `{ from: Date, to: Date, percentage: number }`).
- Use Tailwind + React for rendering.

Please write any new logic in a clean, reusable way (e.g., `calculateNightlyPrice(date, apartmentId)`).
