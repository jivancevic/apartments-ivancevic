I want to create a modern, minimalist, bilingual website for my family's 9 vacation apartments located in Korčula, Croatia. The website's name is "Apartmani Ivančević" and the domain is korcula.bz.

Please create a responsive website with the following structure:

🔵 Main Navigation (Header):

Home

Apartments

What to Visit

Contact

🏠 Home Page:

Hero image with welcome text: “Welcome to Apartmani Ivančević – Your home on Korčula”

Short paragraph about the location and quality of the accommodation

Button: “View Apartments”

Key advantages: close to beach, quiet area, free parking, great views

Button: “Send Booking Inquiry”

🛏️ Apartments Page:

Display apartments as tabs or cards, each showing the apartment’s name and a main photo

When a user clicks “View More” or the tab:

Show a photo gallery

Short and detailed descriptions (I will provide these later)

Icons for amenities: Wi-Fi, kitchen, AC, TV, balcony, sea view, parking

Availability calendar (read-only, not interactive)

Price per night

Button: “Send Inquiry” (links to the contact form or scrolls to it)

📍 What to Visit:

Section listing local recommendations:

Beaches (name, photo, short description)

Restaurants

Attractions and landmarks

Outdoor activities (bike rentals, boat trips, diving)

📞 Contact Page:

Display these contact details:

Embedded Google Map with our location

Note: "We currently do not offer online booking. Please send an inquiry and we will respond as soon as possible."

🌐 Other Features:

Bilingual: Croatian and English (toggle language switch)

Primary color: blue (#1e90ff or similar)

Modern, minimalist style

Logo placeholder (I'll design one separately using an AI tool)

Mobile-friendly

Please generate the HTML/CSS/JS structure and help me get started with content placeholders that I can replace later. Keep the layout clean and intuitive.
