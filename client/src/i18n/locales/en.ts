  "about.family.title": "Welcome to Apartments Ivančević!",
  "about.family.story1": "We are the Ivančević family – Mirica, Vicko, and our children Josip, Roko, and Tonka. We live here on the island, where we work and proudly manage our apartments – which we’ve built and cared for over the years with a lot of love and effort.",
  "about.family.story2": "Both Vicko and I are naval engineers by profession, used to hands-on work, precision, and real results. But life on the island can be unpredictable, and we wanted to have a reliable plan B to build a better future for our children. That’s how we decided to open our home to guests from all around the world – and we’ve never looked back.",
  "about.family.story3": "We don’t come from the tourism industry, but what we offer is honesty, simplicity, and a warm, human connection. We always enjoy chatting with our guests, sharing stories about Korčula, and recommending hidden beaches and local restaurants we truly love.",
  "about.family.story4": "All of our apartments are located just steps from the Old Town, and each one carries a piece of our story. We clean and maintain them ourselves, fix anything that needs fixing, and welcome every guest as if they were a friend. If you need anything during your stay – we’re here for you.",
  "about.family.story5": "Everything we do, we do with the goal of making our guests feel welcome, relaxed, and safe. We're not perfect, but we try to be the kind of hosts we’d love to meet ourselves.",
  "about.family.story6": "For us, this isn’t just a job – it’s a way to live honestly, meet wonderful people, and share with the world why we love our island so much.",
  "about.family.story7": "You're always welcome – and we hope to host you too! 🤍",
